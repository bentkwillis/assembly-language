# assembly-language

 Project with temperature conversion program and various examples written in assembly.

## temperature.asm

temperature.asm is an assembler program that uses loops and procedures to get the temperature value from the user, and convert it to either Centigrade or Fahrenheit, depending on the user's selection.

The program prompts the user for a value and then for a conversion factor C/F. The program has the conversion routines written as a procedure and is called when there's a value to convert.

The output function is written to print the answer to the Console output.

This progran keeps the values as 8 bit integer values, and uses the compare and call instructions.
